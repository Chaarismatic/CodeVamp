## 🏗 Deployment (Railway + Vercel)

The platform is designed for split deployment:
- Backend on Railway
- Frontend on Vercel

### 1. MongoDB Setup
Ensure your **MongoDB Atlas** Network Access allows `0.0.0.0/0` (Allow Access from Anywhere) to support cloud-hosted backend access.

### 2. Environment Variables
Set these in your Railway service:
- `MONGODB_URI`: Your Atlas connection string.
- `JWT_SECRET`: A strong secret key for auth.
- `NODE_ENV`: `production`

Set these in your Vercel project:
- `VITE_API_URL`: Your Railway backend URL (example: `https://<service>.up.railway.app`)

   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   Create a `.env` in `apps/api/`:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongo_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

3. **Run Services**
   ```bash
   # Start Backend
